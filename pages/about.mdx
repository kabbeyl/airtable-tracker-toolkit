## What you will find in the {siteTitle}

This is a test site, and this is test text. This site allows you to see a birds eye view of development at the city or neighborhood level on [the map](./map), or search within [all development projects](./projects) underway. Each development project page includes more information about the taxpayer, what is being built, the status of the project, zoning and more details when available like cost, timelines and site photos.

## Under the hood

The tracker is an open-source tool, and you can view our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jmcbroom/development-tracker) to see the site's code. The site uses a custom base in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), a database-spreadsheet hybrid platform, as a content management system and was built with Next.js, a development framework which uses React.

Other tools we used to build the site, all free or with freemium models, include [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). See more details about implementation at GitHub.
