## What you will need

The following is a list of all the accounts and programs you will need to create your database, set up your site and publish it. 



* An [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup). (The free plan will suffice to get you started, and is possible to use for the entire project – see the Airtable section for more details on free tier limits.)
* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
* A newly [generated SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) you then add to [your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
* Git [installed on your computer](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). 
* A text editor installed on your computer. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular choice that integrates well with GitHub.
* A [Supabase account](https://app.supabase.io/) – you sign in with your GitHub login.  
* A [Mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/). (The free plan will suffice to get you started, and is possible to use for the entire project – see what’s included in Mapbox free vs. paid plans [here](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing)).
* A [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/?_ga=2.114775815.1852513007.1647209877-1609351552.1647209877) – sign in with your GitHub login. (The free plan will suffice to get you started, and is possible to use for the entire project – see what’s included in Netlify free vs. paid plans [here](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/)).
* Admin login for your publication’s site.
* You may want to use a site like[ TinyJPG.com](https://tinyjpg.com/) to optimize images for digital publishing.
* You may want to use a service like [DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/home) if you are collecting numerous PDF files as part of your data collection. (We do not use this.)

These are the skills and areas of knowledge that are involved in building and maintaining the development tracker. This toolkit is designed to be used by someone with some familiarity with these knowledge areas, though you certainly don’t need to be an expert. 



* Real estate reporting experience (by your or your own publication) or a familiarity with local real estate development. 
* Data journalism and research experience.
* Experience with web programming languages, particularly HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Here is what else you will need from within or outside your newsroom. 



* Support and buy-in from newsroom leaders and your audience.
* Assistance from others in your newsroom. You could potentially take on this project alone, but at the very least we’d strongly encourage you to separate out data entry and data review for accuracy’s sake. You will also want to bring an editor in for site copy. You may need additional help publishing the development tracker app on your own outlet’s site, changing the tracker’s branding to match your outlet’s, planning to publicly launch the tracker or for more extensive design or app customization.    
* Time! Publishing a version of the tracker with very limited data and very limited changes to the site could take as little as 10-15 hours if you’re quick, but further data collection will take more time, as will customization of site text, design and data.
